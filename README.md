# WavKit
### By Robbie Neville

This repo contains the codebase for an audio player and editor that I'm calling **WavKit**.
It's still very much in the early stages of development, but since I've been getting into
Electron app development, I thought I'd share my work so far. I have implemented the
audio player to the point where the user can import files and (drum roll) play them! There is
a playback queue feature, and I've just finished implementing a basic playlist feature. 
Also, there is a pretty decent file explorer built in!

## Development

No automated testing has been configured yet. I was just playing around with the app idea
and got a bit sucked in. So, that is something that I will need to address soon - there is
quite a bit of code now...

### Scripts

You can, however, use the following scripts for developmet:

```
npm run dev
```

(for development builds) and 

```
npm start
```

to see it all in action!
